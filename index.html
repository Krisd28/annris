Loving you makes me feel full, your love makes me full, caring for each other makes me full, You make me full sweetheart. 
3 months without you left me empty, empty of everything, which shows the impact you have on this guy's life hehe.
 The way you care for me, trying to cheer me up, make me laugh and smile and blush just makes me want u more and more and more and I really wanna spend the rest of my life with you, love you unconditionally in person everyday, die next to you. 
 I will end this letter by saying that we have a future, we can make it if we want it, you want me by your own will hence no one stop you, we are gonna end up in each other's arms.
  I'm gonna Have my angel right next to me feeling her warmth one day.

    <div class="back_text"><h3>It's Aug 8th!!, 2 years since we met, 2 years of this amazing bond, friendship, laughter, jokes, goofyness which turned into love, love, love and umm yeah love. 
                    The number 8 is so special to us that even August is numbered 8!, like 8/08/25, which shows that we were supposed to meet on that specific day, specific month and even confess our love on that specific date like it just makes our relationship so special and unique.
                     2 years with you has been a roller-coaster I'd like to get on a 100 times, a roller-coaster that changed my life, the way I see life, the way I see myself. 
                      2 years of butterflies in my stomach, 2 years of blushing, smiling, 2 years of crushing on u, falling for u deeply. 

Let's celebrate 2 spl occasions on one day which is so unique, meeting on the same date and also starting our relationship on the same date. 
The day of meeting you for the first time and also our anniversary of love falling on the same day and month, just makes me have butterflies all over again. </h3>
